**Doctors need HIPAA-secure communication if they are to share [critical patient information][1] and collaborate with medical colleagues. That's what rural primary care doctor [Tracey Haas, MD][2] discovered as she practiced in an area that didn't even have a cardiologist or orthopedic surgeon. HIPAA regulations tied her hands whenever she looked at a patient EKG or X-ray and needed a real-time expert opinion from another doctor, like her husband, orthopedic surgeon [Dr. Tim Gueramy][3]. Prior to the start of [DocbookMD®][4], a secure way to communicate physician-to-physician didn't exist, so doctors, including Haas and Gueramy struggled to provide immediate and efficient care to patients.**

**When the first [iPhone®][5] came out in 2007, [_sans_][6][ camera][6], apps or app store, Haas and Gueramy began talking to other doctors to build the first use cases for DocbookMD, which went from directory app upon its launch in 2009 to communication app and finally to today's iteration -- a critical collaboration platform.**

Healthcare has a cornocopia of information in a multitude of forms: patient records, medical images, prescriptions, patient bills, insurance claims and data research. Healthcare organizations not only must securely store data but they are mandated to process and cater to this data using a variety of data management and process solutions. If that isn't enough, healthcare providers are also required to have this data available on demand and through boundaries, whilst simultaenously focusing on the core principles of patient care delivery. DocbookMD needed a partner in order to comply with these industry necessities.

In dealing with an early-stage company, companies often get a mixed bag with performance. However, Haas said that Catalyze exceeded expectations with zero problems, which has created a positive experience for everyone, especially engineering. Gueramy states that four factors played into the company's decision to go with the [Catalyze cohesive approach to integration][7] versus building a solution themselves:

1. **The Catalyze business model** — "It's cloud-based and exactly like our business model."
2. **Enabled DocbookMD to scale **—"That was a big one!"
3. **Allowed the company a way to capture what future costs were going to be** \-- "That provided a way to charge our customers more appropriately and keep our costs down."
4. **Catalyze being physician-based** — "That was huge."
