The Catalyze [Healthcare Innovation Series][1] is an ongoing collection of interviews with a few of the industry's brightest minds. For the past two years, we have asked participants the question **_how does healthcare innovate_**? We have had the privilege of asking esteemed individuals from [Aneesh Chopra][2], First U.S. CTO and CEO & Co-founder of NavHealth, to [Trey Lauderdale][3], CEO of Voalte. With the increasing popularity of the series, it has become clear that the thoughts of these leaders must be heard. So in joint efforts with these figures to intrigue and inspire, we are proud to begin releasing quarterly eBooks that are able to thematically link what sparks, inspires and ignites innovation.

[Innovation Doesn't Follow Rules][4] is our second eBook in this series following our 2015 eBook, [4 Big Ideas on Innovation][5]. This latest **free** release will cover thoughts from

* [Jordan Shalin, MD][6] – Founder Healthloop, Creator of Tincture
* [Trey Lauderdale][3] – CEO of Voalte
* [Dr. Chris Wasden][7] – Executive Director, Sorenson Center for Discovery and Innovation at the University of Utah
* [Aneesh Chopra][2] – Co-founder & CEO NavHealth; First U.S. CTO & Former Virginia Sec. of Technology

As could be interpreted by the title, these leaders did not follow the rules; they broke them. The regular status quo has become the great adversary of innovation. Innovation has become nothing but the understanding of the necessity for change and then possessing the ability to deliver it. Why now? Because there's no better time than now.
