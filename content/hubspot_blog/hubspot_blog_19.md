summary: |
    In a city underrated by those who have never visited, Madison, WI, brings more to the Midwest than its prestigious university and famous State Street. The Midwest is [predicted to have more startups than Silicon Valley in five years][1]. VentureBeat author Chris Olson states, "Today entrepreneurs are building more billion-dollar companies in the Midwest than in the last 50 years combined." It's time for Madison to be on the radar among the national startup community.

The entrepreneurial activity in Madison can be attributed to the top talent from the University of Wisconsin and large local companies (AmFam, Epic Systems, etc). The startup community here varies from micro-breweries to medical devices. Whether it's a first-time entrepreneur opening her new soap business or a serial entrepreneur focusing on patient engagement, resources bring the entrepreneurial community together.

Three examples are [100 State][2], [1 Million Cups][3] and the [Weinert Center for Entrepreneurship][4]. Although each resource differs in purpose, they share two commonalities: 1) bringing entrepreneurs together and 2) leveraging network diversity for growth. Even meetups are growing to help unite entrepreneurs in the area. As Brian Lee from Madisonstartups.com put it, "Madison has a full ecosystem of resources and organizations all working toward a common goal."   
  
One example of the community coming together is 1 Million Cups, a weekly meetup for startups to present their ideas and receive audience feedback. I remember my first time at 1 Million Cups as I watched Catalyze's Chief Strategy Officer present to the audience. The audience consisted of employees from Nordic Consulting Group, consulting,  financial firms and startups. This diverse group provided great feedback for Catalyze, while audience engagement buzzed with energy and inspired us to further work within the Madison startup community.

Likewise, the Madison business community also comes together to support each other, to which health technology shines brightly. Catalyze is thrilled to be a central example: We work closely with customers like Propeller Health, Healthfinch, Health eFillings, Wellbe, [m]Pirik, Ensodata, True Health Connection, and CE Learning Systems. We maintain several integrations with regional health systems, such as Aurora Healthcare, Froedtert & The Medical College of WI, and Children's Hospital of WI â€” all of which are taking innovative approaches toward addressing healthcare needs.

Along with industry giants Epic and Nordic, the Madison health technology community is working together to solve important problems. As Aristotle once said, "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts," and Catalyze is happy to be a part of it.
