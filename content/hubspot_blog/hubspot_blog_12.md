We completed our initial HITRUST assessment about three years ago. The process of working with the HITRUST CSF, our 3rd party HITRUST approved auditors, and HITRUST as a certifying body had a steep learning curve; we've since completed additional HITRUST assessments and extended our HITRUST CSF Validated Assessment to include additional service providers and certify product and organizational changes. Since achieving our HITRUST Certification, our goal has been to educate the industry about our [experience][1], both positive and negative, with HITRUST, and lower the barrier for others to achieve HITRUST Certification.

We feel strongly that the healthcare industry needs a true industry-accepted certification for security and compliance in order to streamline the adoption of new technologies while maintaining the highest privacy standards for health-related data. HITRUST represents that certification in healthcare today.  We've seen the power of HITRUST at reducing our contracting process with certain covered entities from months to minutes (or however long it takes to securely upload your HITRUST Certification report). Achieving a CSF Validated Assessment, especially for those new to HITRUST, is a time consuming and [expensive][2] endeavor. That's why we're so excited HITRUST launched it's [inheritance program][3] this summer and will fully incorporate the concept of inheritance into the CSF this December.

We knew the HITRUST CSF Inheritance Program was on the HITRUST roadmap for several years and we felt it would be a huge benefit to our customers. In the words of HITRUST:

> This program simplifies the process and reduces the effort for hosting and service organization customers. By working with a participating service provider, customers can reduce the required testing and associated costs for inherited controls in a fully automated manner.

Catalyze is proud to be a participating service provider in the inheritance program because it enables our customers to explicitly lean on us, and our specific controls, proof, and scores in the CSF, to streamline their own HITRUST Certification. We are working on our own guide for customers that will help estimate how much of the burden of HITRUST this relieves and what specific controls you should inherit from us. Of the roughly 7,000 entries within our own CSF, we know there is a lot of work, time, and money that our customers can get back by using this feature in the CSF.

Using the inheritance program is [straightforward][4]. Below is a summary of the steps.

1. When completing your CSF, choose "Request Inheritance" for any requirements you plan to inherit from Catalyze. Do this throughout the CSF. Our guide should help immensely with this.
2. From the Assessment page you can then choose "Inheritance Request". This will take you to a screen where you will see all the requirements to which you selected "Request Inheritance". If you inherit all of the controls from Catalyze, as most of our customers will, you can choose all of the items in the list then select "Catalyze" from the Vendor list.
3. Catalyze will then approve all those relevant controls from your request and you'll be notified via email.
That's it. As you can see by the simplicity of the process, we think this is a huge win for our customers. We've spent lots of time and money to prove how we comply with both HIPAA and HITRUST, and now our customers can fully leverage that work directly within the HITRUST CSF.
