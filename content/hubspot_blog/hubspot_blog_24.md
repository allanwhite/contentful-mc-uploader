From expanding our services to new podcast appearances, July had a lot of excitement to capture for Catalyze. As we continue to push towards a value-based healthcare system and simultaneously navigate new regulations, we have progressively built additional support for our clients while bringing further credibility to them and their clients. We are proud of all that we achieved in July so just to name a few, here are a few highlights.  

## Bringing HITRUST CSF Certification to AWS

Catalyze's compliant cloud platform is now HITRUST CSF Certified for its customers hosting workloads on [Amazon Web Services][1] (AWS). Catalyze passed its Common Security Framework (CSF) assessment from the Health Information Trust Alliance ([HITRUST][2]) — the industry's benchmark for measuring compliance and security. By utilizing AWS services and solutions, Catalyze provides a fully managed Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliant and HITRUST CSF Certified platform for the healthcare industry that offers development teams fast, flexible, and secure access to the cloud.

"Healthcare is an industry in the midst of transitioning to the cloud, and AWS is strategically positioned to service the healthcare industry's computing needs. AWS's work with Catalyze, a company that focuses on meeting healthcare's unique compliance needs through security frameworks like HITRUST, helps position AWS to play a key role in the health industry's transformation," said Josh Hofmann, Global Lead, Partner Ecosystem, Amazon Web Services, Inc.

## Cofounder Dr. Travis Good Featured in Becker's and Practice Mentors

Is health IT really 'digital snake oil?' Eight industry leaders, including Dr. Travis Good, reacted to Dr. James Madara's speech and were featured in Becker's Health IT & CIO Review. Dr. Madara[ made the comparison][7] in his address at the 2016 AMA Annual Meeting. "From ineffective EHRs to an explosion of direct-to-consumer digital health products to apps, some of which are poor quality — this is the digital snake oil of the 21st century," he said. But not all stakeholders share Dr. Madara's criticism of the digital health landscape. Dr. Travis Good, among other healthcare stakeholders weighed in on "digital snake oil," and whether that's a fair description of the digital health landscape in [Becker's recent publication][8].

As we all should know, compliance is mandatory. So stop and think about how many electronic devices you use everyday. Are they all HIPAA compliant? Are you assuming that others take care of that for you? Dr. Travis Good had the pleasure of being featured in the [Practice Mentors Podcast: Electronic Devices And HIPAA Compliance Is Mandatory][9]. You may be surprised as you listen to Travis Good and Kathleen Mills discuss the finer points of this topic. You'll want to know these safeguards to protect yourself from unwanted trouble that could end your practice.
