Genius can often be defined by insightful measures. From the arts to the sciences, having insight is the most effective method to developing understanding. Whether you desire to delve into a new area of expertise or explore a more generalized subject matter, having insight is critical. No one can advocate for this imperative more than Catalyze's new Chief Product Officer, Raj Sundaramurthy.

> "Keep the main thing, the main thing." — Stephen Covey

Born in India, Raj has an educational background in mechanical engineering and business but began his professional career in the finance sector at [CitiBank][1] in New York. Later in his career, he somehow ended up at a healthcare startup in Dallas and the rest is history. Raj has made impacts at many healthcare organizations but his most recent was at the highly-esteemed [Equifax][2] where he served as the Identity & Fraud Division CIO and Senior Vice-President for Technology and Analytical Services.

Some may be wondering why Raj would make the leap from being an enterprise executive back to a small organization's leadership team. Raj has always been a product guy and although Raj and I go way back, there were two main influences that brought him to Catalyze: 1) Excitement about an innovative product company, 2) Belief in a small company that can make a difference while working alongside known, highly-regarded industry colleagues. 

Catalyze today is a platform, compliance, integration company. Raj believes that the next evolution is that it will become an insights story and Catalyze will be able to directly assist the care process. Catalyze has the data, analytics, insights and that's what is differentiating. The healthcare landscape is always changing in a value based payment structure, so how is value measured? The answer: the ability to intervene or act during the patient care cycle with complete transparency. Action items for these insights will be what providers will need to put in place. So what are some of the factors that collectively contribute to the flaws in our system? Many cannot intervene during the patient care process, it is nearly always post-care. Assuming work can be done inside the compliance umbrella, the analytics will be the key to the insight.

"Catalyze needs to be able to deliver solutions and offerings that make a difference. The ability to work it from the beginning. This is going to start something new and exciting." — Raj Sundaramurthy

When Raj isn't acting as the insightful innovator that he is, he can be found watching sports with his wife and two children in Dallas, Texas. He is a family-oriented, man of his word that believes when a commitment is made, it must be honored. No cancellations. No adjustments. No excuses. Now that's someone we're proud to have on our team.
