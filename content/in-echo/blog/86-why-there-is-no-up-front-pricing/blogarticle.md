Summary: 
Lead: |
Someone the other day told us that they didn't trust us because we didn't have up front pricing on our website. It's the only thing we heard from them before they walked out the virtual door of our website. I'm sorry we didn't get a good chance to engage, because I would have loved to talk about why we do this.

Body: |
The [common startup zeitgeist](https://al3x.net/2012/02/29/how-not-to-sell-software-in-2012.html) suggests human interaction between prospect and customer is a failure. We strongly believe this isn't a global maxim, at least for early-stage companies. For Catalyze, we've found greater success in being human-centric, sales-orientated, and would like to share our insight.

First, our pricing is non-standard, which can lead to buyer confusion. The result is frustrated prospects who now dislike the brand. We actually used to have a few pricing calculators on our website throughout 2014. We've since removed them because the way our pricing is calculated is complex. Complexity for the user is the enemy, even when marketing a product.

We have a few basic guidelines, but we've removed pricing from the up front conversation to focus on benefits and features. This isn't because we're trying to be disingenuous or hit you with some slick-back sales guy stuff; lord knows, I learned how to ply my trade at a place that had [virtually no sales team](http://www.forbes.com/sites/zinamoukheiber/2012/04/18/epic-systems-tough-billionaire/).

Second, we discovered prospects were making apples-to-oranges comparisons with companies who weren't direct competitors. It's very difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison between our Platform as a Service and an Infrastructure as a Service vendor like AWS. The feature sets are way different, and—more importantly—the outcomes are different. A most important example: AWS doesn't make you fully HIPAA compliant. Plus, we've incurred many costs in R&D and through licensing with 3rd party vendors to provide things like firewalls and vulnerability scanning as part of our offering. So, while we may price packages by containers or VMs, as the customer you get so much more and benefit from Catalyze being able to distribute costs across all of our customers.

Third, we saw that often prospects weren't entirely sure which one of our products to choose, so they would choose neither. We offer two best-in-class products to store and protect your PHI, [PaaS](/paas) and [BaaS](/baas), plus managed HL7 integration services. We'd like to know more about your startup and product so that we can help you pick the right one. Our competitors, to my knowledge, only offer one or the other. You know the saying that when all you have is a hammer everything looks like a nail? We're more like Home Depot. It sure is easy to get lost in there sometimes. Let us help you find what you need.

Fourth, we believe strongly in a core message of the Lean Startup movement: We want to talk to people. After several months, we can safely report back that it makes a huge difference. Four key observations came out of forcing conversations with prospects.

- We honed in on how to best help startups. For newer startups, we know you might need to promise some infrastructure or get something started as you wait for your first contract to come through. We're willing to work with you so that you can deliver what you need while not breaking the bank up front.

- We learned the Catalyze origin story is inspiring. I'd like to tell you about our story and our team. Why did we do this? What have we learned in the last few years? What benefits have our partners reaped from our products? We have years of healthcare and infrastructure experience at Catalyze, forged in the trenches on projects around the world. We built Catalyze's products based on what we've learned.

- We're programmers building tools for programmers. If we don't do something that you want us to do, we'd like to know why so we can fix it or explain why we made a decision a certain way. It's hard to do that on one static web page.

- We discovered Catalyze has a lot more to offer beyond just the technology. We're digital health geeks and are excited you want to build something to make a difference. If there's any way else we can help you through either introductions or sales support, we'd love to be there.  

So give us a chance if you want to know more about pricing. Chat with us on Olark or shoot us an email. We'd love to help you out.
