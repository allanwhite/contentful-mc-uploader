### What is **telehealth**?

Telehealth encompasses a vast range of logistics, policies, and technologies in order to yield the desired communication results of the users. The federal [HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration)](http://www.hrsa.gov/ruralhealth/about/telehealth/telehealth.html) defines telehealth as

> The use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies to support long-distance clinical health care, patient and professional health-related education, public health and administration.

There are other definitions and interpretations of telehealth from different state and federal entities, which does influence the regulations and policies that control what is permitted in relations. But one constant that is echoed, regardless of the source, is the importance of HIPAA compliance. 

**That’s where Catalyze comes in.**

With the Joint Commission placing a ban on all plain text messaging for any conveyance of protected health information (PHI), the need for discreet information transmission is of utmost importance and urgency merited by HIPAA and HITECH regulations. A single willful neglect breach of unprotected communications could consequent in a fine up to $50, 000. And repeat violators could see annual fines as high as $1.5 million. And if that isn’t enough, this doesn’t take into account the unrepairable damage to an association’s reputation and credibility that would ensue soon after. 

### Are these risks worth not being HIPAA compliant?

Catalyze is here to take worry out of all of the above. Our telehealth business partners leverage our HIPAA expertise to ensure they never have to pay a fine due to a HIPAA violation.
