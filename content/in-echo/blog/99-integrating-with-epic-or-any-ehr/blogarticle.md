Summary: 
Lead: |
We are often asked about integrating with Epic, Cerner, Allscripts and every other EHR big or small. The people asking us for help range from digital health rookies to industry leaders. The process of setting up an integration, from security to management, can be tricky, time consuming and expensive.

Body: |
Since we launched our HL7 product last year we learned plenty of lessons about running an integration project on-time and on-budget. Even with years of guiding hospitals through Epic installs and being a former digital health startup founder myself, there were nuances to connecting the intersection of those two worlds that took some time to learn. Out goal is to make those nuances less foreign and more approachable so that _anyone_ can set up an integration without being afraid of the consequences.

We recently added a new entry to our [Learn](https://catalyze.io/learn) library where we discuss the process of integrating with Epic or any other EHR. It's more of a process and less of a technical exercise than you may think. [Read our overview on how to integrate with Epic.](https://catalyze.io/learn/how-to-integrate-with-epic-or-any-ehr)

Included in the new entry is a link to our 30-day project plan for HL7 installs. Full disclosure: working within the constraints of a healthcare organization might have an impact on your go-live date. Despite this, we've managed to run through this plan even faster in the past. Part of the reason we can move so quickly is that we've automated most of the deployment and have the talent in house to execute on it. I'm proud of the HL7 team we've built so far and I'm looking forward to expanding our team and our platform in 2015. [You can learn more about our HL7 services here.](https://catalyze.io/hl7)
