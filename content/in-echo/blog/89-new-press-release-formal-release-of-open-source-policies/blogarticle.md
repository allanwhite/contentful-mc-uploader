Lead: |
  Several months ago we shared our company policies in hopes of helping other digital health startups and businesses get one step closer to HIPAA compliance without having to take on the burden of getting there. Since then we've been gathering feedback from the health tech community, and made several updates to the [policies](http://catalyzeio.github.io/policies/), with more updates in store.

Tags: policy, open source

After receiving an overwhelming amount positive feedback from those who have found the policies useful, we have decided to [formally announce ](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/01/prweb12442733.htm)the policies as broadly available.

Katelyn Gleason, Founder and CEO of [Eligible](https://www.eligibleapi.com/), is one of many who used the policies as a starting point. Eligible has saved a considerable amount of money in doing so. "We believe that for Catalyze to open source these documents is truly groundbreaking in healthcare IT, " she told us.

If you have found these policies useful, drop us a line at [hello@catalyze.io](mailto:hello@catalyze.io)!
