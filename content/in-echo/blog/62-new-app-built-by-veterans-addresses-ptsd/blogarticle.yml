As the nation has learned more about the challenges faced by veterans easing back into civilian life, Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) has gained the attention of the healthcare world. But it’s not just healthcare professionals putting in the effort to address PTSD. Veterans themselves are teaming up to support the lives of one another.

A group of LA-based veterans have created a mobile application called [Position Report](http://pos-rep.com/), or POS REP for short. The app is meant to link veterans suffering from PTSD up with nearby veterans for support.

POS REP is endorsed by the Department of Veteran Affairs, and is an example of the diversity of efforts the VA is taking to address PTSD as well as the embrace of new technology to engage and empower patients. Catalyze is a technology partner with the VA and proud to support such initiatives, helping the VA move faster with Catalyze HIPAA compliant infrastructure.

To read more about POS REP and the team behind it, check out the original article from the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/health/la-na-military-suicides-20140817-story.html).
