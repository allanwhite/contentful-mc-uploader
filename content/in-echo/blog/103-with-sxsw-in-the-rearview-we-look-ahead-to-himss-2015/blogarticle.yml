SXSW was a blast. Catalyze had the chance to participate in a panel discussion for digital health startups. Our CEO [Travis Good](https://catalyze.io/travis) answered tough questions around HIPAA and regulation.

We often find HIPAA's perceived complexity exists mainly due to lack of awareness or education, which is not the fault of digital health startups or those new to healthcare. Instead, it's the fault of poorly designed and inaccessible resources. We strongly believe that we are helping to accelerate innovation within healthcare not just through our [products](https://catalyze.io/products), but also through our [free educational content](https://catalyze.io/learn). Making ourselves available at events  to answer questions and lend advice is all part of our mission to lessen the burden of HIPAA on those who want to change healthcare.

## Looking ahead to HIMSS 2015

April 12-16 sees the bulk of the healthcare technology world descend upon Chicago for 2015's HIMSS conference. Catalyze is attending. [Travis](https://catalyze.io/travis) and [Mohan](https://catalyze.io/mohan) along with our integrations lead Mark Olschesky will be walking the floor. We will have a physical presence at booth 1699, hosted by fellow Madison health technology firm [Nordic](http://www.nordicwi.com/).

If you have an interest in meeting someone from the team, please feel free to message them on twitter or send us an email at [hello@catalyze.io](mailto:hello@catalyze.io) to be connected.

There are many great events, panels, and conversations planned. We are in particular looking forward to the new [Cybersecurity Command Center](http://www.himssconference.org/exhibition/cybersecurity-command-center), which is stacked with intriguing discussions Monday through Wednesday.

Of course, the [Innovation](http://www.himssconference.org/networking/innovation) networking event looks promising, along with the [CIO Forum](http://www.himssconference.org/education/cio-forum). Both align well with the ethos of our [Innovation Series](https://catalyze.io/innovation).

[#HIMSS15](http://www.himssconference.org/updates/update.aspx?ItemNumber=40200) kicks off two weeks from today, and we are excited to attend.
