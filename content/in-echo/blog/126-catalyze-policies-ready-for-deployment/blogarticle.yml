Body: As a continuous effort in helping our loyal customers handle compliance with ease, we have created a deployable version of our widely popular open-source compliance policies. [Grab a copy for yourself here.](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies-deployable)

When we first open-sourced our policies we were not expecting to be enamored with such praise. It's not everyday that you woo the [hacker crowd](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8461078) with a long list of markdown files. However we were excited when we started seeing the number of stars and forks on GitHub rise and rise. Today we're excited to announce a new step in bringing our policies to your compliance efforts. We've officially launched a deployable version of our compliance policies!

To help you get setup we've created a short tutorial that should have you up and running in no time. That can found [here](https://github.com/catalyzeio/policies-deployable/wiki/Getting-Started-Tutorial).

As always we're here to help. If you have any questions in regards to our policies feel free to reach out directly to us at [hello@catalyze.io](mailto:hello@catalyze.io).
