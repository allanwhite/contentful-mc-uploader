If you haven’t heard of [Zipnosis, Inc.](https://zipnosis.com/) yet, you’re missing out on some of the latest, greatest, and most convenient innovations to modern mainstream medicine.

And with such a flourishing relationship, Catalyze will be right there every step of the way as Zipnosis scales its business, while still providing the highest level of professional expertise and services as both colleagues and friends.
