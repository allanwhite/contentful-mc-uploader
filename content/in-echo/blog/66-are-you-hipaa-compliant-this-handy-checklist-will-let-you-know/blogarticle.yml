When we talk to companies who handle Protected Health Information (PHI), often the first topic of discussion is simply understanding what it takes to be HIPAA compliant.

"Am I HIPAA compliant? I don't even know."

This is by far the question we're asked most often. HIPAA is so complex, people usually aren't even sure how it applies to them.

HIPAA doesn't have to be complicated. So we took this queue and simplified compliance into a [15-question checklist](https://catalyze.io/hipaa-self-assessment-checklist). We walk you through a series of Yes/No questions, offering advice along the way. When finished, we tally up the results and let you know if your system or mobile app is compliant.

So far it has been helpful to those wondering how HIPAA applies to them. If you're in a similar position, take a few minutes and [give it a try](https://catalyze.io/hipaa-self-assessment-checklist).
