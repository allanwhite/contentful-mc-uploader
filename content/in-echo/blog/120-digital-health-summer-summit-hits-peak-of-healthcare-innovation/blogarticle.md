Going into the 2015 Digital Health Summer Summit this past week, we at Catalyze knew that we were in for an exhilarating time amongst our healthcare confreres, but we had no conception as to the impression we would be leaving the event with. And there’s only one word to put it simply — Wow! 

### UCSF Innovation Lab Tours

The two-day gathering began Thursday, June 18, with an extraordinary tour through three leading innovations centers at UCSF - The Gazzaley Lab, UCSF Human Performance Center at the Orthopedic Institute, and the UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay. There we got to take an unparalleled glimpse into these state-of-the-art digital health facilities and witness their inner functionalities. Starting with the Human Performance Center, launched in 2014, we got to better understand how this innovative organization helps athletes better understand how they perform and what they can do to prevent and work around injuries while simultaneously optimizing efficiency. This lab is also a joint innovation UCSF has with Samsung, being the first-of-its-kind, where innovators and entrepreneurs can validate their technologies and accelerate the adoption of new preventative health solutions. Next up, The Gazzaley Lab, where we witnessed some of the latest and greatest happenings in modern cognitive neuroscience from the neural mechanics of memory to the possibilities of therapeutic intervention to alleviate cognitive deficits. And finally as the last stop on our tour, an up-close and personal look at the brand new UCSF Medical Center at Mission Bay. When they say that this hospital was built with “a focus on the patient’s experience every step of the way, ” they weren’t kidding. Walk inside and you’ll find state-of-the-art, cutting-edge technology including personalized robotics and telemedicine that concurrently produces the highest merits of patient safety, energy efficiency, seismic readiness and environmental sustainability. 

### The Summit

Moving on to the date of the Summit, Friday, June 19, hosted at the Mission Bay Conference Center, we got to start bright and early prepped and ready for a full day of innovative and inspiring sessions broken down into three parts - Growth in Innovation, Building Transformative Partnerships, and Winning Strategies Declassified. 

### Part One: Growth in Innovation

Starting with Reed V. Tuckson MD, FACP, we got an eye-opening welcome into where the digital health industry currently stands and where it is predicted to go. Dr. Tuckson discusses this multi-billion dollar industry and how it is driving the development towards preventative healthcare and precision medicine. Also in this session, we got to hear what driving success factors are when it comes to startup funding from top-tier investors in the digital health arena. With such an intriguing and informative opening, we had to stick around for part two. 

### Part Two: Building Informative Partnerships

There seemed to be a recurring theme throughout the conference that was addressed to be a key building block in the digital health industry - importance of partnerships. In part two, we got to hear how finding the right partnership to coincide with your company’s core needs to be held with the utmost tact and diplomacy. We got to hear from multiple sides and their insights, and among these presenters was Karan Singh, Co-Founder of [Ginger.io](https://ginger.io/), who has multiple affiliations, and among those, a partnership with UCSF where Ginger.io’s aggregator utilization dashboard processes are employed across multiple departments including orthopedic surgery. Ginger.io is at a cornerstone in digital health and pushing the needle forward towards preventative healthcare and precision medicine. We were humbled to hear their thoughts and take major considerations back with us when confronted with our own business development. 

### Part Three: Winning Strategies Declassified

In part three, our very own CEO and Co-Founder, Travis Good, got to speak on a panel alongside Molly Coye, MD, Former CIO of UCLA Health, and Adam Odessky, Co-Founder and CEO Sense.ly, Inc., in a session titled “Dealmaking, Piloting and Scaling: Do You Have What it Takes?” With the growing popularity in the digital health industry, many get lost in the endless pool of bureaucracy, so how do digital health companies execute lucratively into the healthcare systems? As Molly Coye states, as former CIO in healthcare, “the first thing we’re looking for is for someone to bring us a solution instead of merely describing the problem.” The panel goes on to speak on different entrepreneurial approaches, technical execution strategies, and scalability in healthcare products. These are all factors that play into wether survival in healthcare is apropos or inapposite to digital health.

At the end of it all, our minds were overloaded with context into our growing profession and popularity. The insights we gained will guide us to continue to better healthcare and how we should adjust and maneuver our approach. We were proud to be in attendance and a sponsor of such an incredible event and look forward to returning in years to come. A huge thank you to everyone who made the event possible. We are truly diffident by all that is happening but are filled with triumph and rejoice in seeing such a magnificent impact that we, as an industry, continue to make daily.
