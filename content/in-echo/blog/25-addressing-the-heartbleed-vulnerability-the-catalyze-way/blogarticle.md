On April 7th, [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) informed the industry of a vulnerability known as the ‘Heartbleed bug’ ([CVE-2014-0160](http://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140407.txt)). This vulnerability can be remotely exploited to leak encrypted information and secrets from any application using OpenSSL, allowing an attacker to potentially steal usernames, passwords, and private keys. This also inherently compromises any private key (including those used for SSL certificates), allowing an attacker to view any information encrypted via that key. As of Wednesday at 02:45 AM CST, all Catalyze certificates have been re-keyed and redeployed.

Upon learning about the issue, the engineering team at Catalyze quickly went into action and formulated a plan to upgrade our infrastructure. The upgrade would happen in 4 stages:

* Upgrading the OpenSSL Packages;

* Restarting the Services;

* Re-keying our SSL Certificates; and

* Verifying our web properties are not affected.

Here at Catalyze, we use [Salt](http://www.saltstack.com/) to manage most of our infrastructure, so upgrading the OpenSSL versions and restarting services is quite trivial. That said, there is a lot of coordination that must happen in order to minimize downtime. We came up with a plan and were able to execute and upgrade all systems in our environment within 2 hours. We then restarted all web services and other services that utilize OpenSSL.

Next, we re-keyed our SSL certificates and began changing them out on all of our applications. Most SSL certificate providers will allow you to re-key your SSL certificate at no charge and ours was no exception. After re-keying our certificates, we began deploying them across our infrastructure.

Finally, we utilized the [Heartbleed command line tool](https://github.com/FiloSottile/Heartbleed) to scan each of our sites and verify the bug was corrected (along with verifying OpenSSL versions, verifying the new Private Key, etc).

Thank you for trusting us with your data. This is a responsibility we take very seriously and we will continue to work diligently to ensure the security and integrity of all systems in the Catalyze Platform.
