  Healthcare is ready—and in need—for [innovation](https://catalyze.io/innovation). Most innovation stems from academia, allowing data scientists, economists and medical professionals to collaborate more openly than in contrast to a corporate setting, but fresh ideas come from private sectors of healthcare as well. As workflow pressures increase, healthcare system executives are faced with a challenging decision of continuing to focus on regulatory burdens, security threats, and changing reimbursement models or to allocate the time and resources necessary for effective innovation amongst the myriad of mandated organizational projects.

As healthcare systems switch gears towards [innovation](https://catalyze.io/solutions/enterprise-innovation), leadership must ask themselves what is needed to enhance productivity, create generalized tools, and reduce niche systems within their organization. With 2016 rapidly approaching, here are a few desired innovations:

- The ability to deploy secure, enterprise class texting that is fault indulgent, role-based messaging, maintains delegation when unavailable and completely audible.

- Closed loop transactions with the utmost secure coupling among organizations required by interoperability use cases. [FHIR](https://catalyze.io/learn/introduction-to-fhir) could be the solution to achieve this.

- Increasingly more important, patient generated healthcare data, objective and subjective, from middleware like [Apple HealthKit](https://catalyze.io/blog/getting-started-with-apple-healthkit-part-1) will need to be incorporated into patient records.

- A solution that will allow easy access for patients to access their personal records instead of utilizing the SSLVPN web-based access while still protecting PHI and maintaining [HIPAA compliance](https://catalyze.io/learn/proving-hipaa-compliance). 

- A collaboration space, such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn, for sharing ideas, messages and files among peers that will support a healthcare organization workflow. 

Innovation can be bought or built. Healthcare enterprises will need to hone in on their innovation programs while also utilizing vendors and service providers simultaneously. Don’t let your organization fail to see the value in change when you are faced with the crossroads of monotony and innovation.
