Zipnosis, a customer of Catalyze's HIPAA compliance cloud computing platform, has been selected to be a final presenter at the [Chicago Venture Summit event on October 15th](http://www.chicagoventuresummit.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Chicago-Venture-Summit-Announces-Final-Presenters-Sept-19-2014-FINAL.pdf). Hand-picked along with 14 other companies, Zipnosis will join a group of 30 midwest startups who will get the opportunity to pitch to members of the Midwest Fortune 100. It's not just a fundraising opportunity, but a chance to create meaningful business relationships.

The announcement comes on the heels of another selection. A few days prior, [Zipnosis was picked by _Minnesota Business Magazine_ as a leader in healthcare IT](https://blog.zipnosis.com/2014/09/17/2014-finalist/).

Both of these announcements follow a previous big win. In August [Zipnosis was picked to power the University of Alabama-Birmingham eMedicine program](http://www.newswise.com/articles/uab-medicine-launches-state-s-first-online-service-to-treat-common-medical-conditions). The program is the state's first venture into telemedicine, and will offer online diagnosis and treatment of common conditions.

Zipnosis is on a roll! We're happy to be a valued partner of theirs and look to support their continued success. To learn more, check out [their website](https://zipnosis.com/) or follow them on [Twitter @zipnosis](https://twitter.com/zipnosis).
