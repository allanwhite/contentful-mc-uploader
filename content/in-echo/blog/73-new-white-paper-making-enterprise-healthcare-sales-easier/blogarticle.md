Believe us, we know. We've sold to large enterprise healthcare organizations who are now happy customers and important partners. But we also have an intimate understanding because of our role helping smaller customers sell into these same institutions.

Partly because we've been through three independent audits, partly because we are thought leaders in compliance and security, but mostly because of our track record of successful service.

When digital health companies choose Catalyze, they also get the trust and history that make CIOs raise their eyebrow.
