We think the words of our clients say more about Catalyze than our own. Tha'’s why when one of our clients has a challenge that Catalyze can meet and exceed we let them tell you about it.

Mayank Thanawala, Vice-President of Research and Development for HealthLoop – a company that is tracking patient recovery and improving outcomes with its automated patient follow-up solution, talked recently on-camera about his experience with switching his present hosting company to Catalyze and what led to that decision.

In this latest [customer testimonial video](https://catalyze.io/proof), Thanawala speaks from the HealthLoop offices in Mountain View, California, about his team's challenge in finding a replacement hosting solution. The challenge? Find a more stable, secure and scalable infrastructure so that his team could focus less on compliance and spend more time concentrating on the company's innovative healthcare product. The solution? Catalyze.

If you store, process, or transmit Protected Health Information (PHI), [let's chat about your compliance needs](https://catalyze.io/compliance) and how Catalyze can help.
