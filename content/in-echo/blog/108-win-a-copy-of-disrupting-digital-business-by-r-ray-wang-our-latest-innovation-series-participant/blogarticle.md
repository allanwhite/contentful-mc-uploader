This was a particularly special interview for us because of Ray's experience with healthcare _and_ business models. Business models are often a root instigator for innovation, regardless of industry. That healthcare is presently going through a shift makes the relationship between business models and innovation especially timely. His breadth and depth of knowledge made for an exciting interview with [Travis](https://catalyze.io/). The two of them spanned from the transitioning business models to Big Pharma to EHRs and back.
