Summary:
Body: |
The answer is that the cloud holds almost **limitless potential for developers**. Amazon and Rackspace, and an increasingly diverse group of other vendors, have commoditized cloud computing in its most raw form. These vendors provide access to virtual servers, shared or dedicated, hosted in secure data centers with extremely high up-times. There's no up-front or hardware costs for these services, so the barriers to getting up and running are basically gone.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is truly disruptive for developers, from independent developers to small vendors to large enterprises. IaaS is like a blank canvas for developers - setup a server in minutes and start configuring it with services and security. If you need another server, just duplicate the server image you've already got. The core value is the flexibility that it gives developers.

With the advent of service layers abstracted from IaaS, we're seeing more disruption as additional barriers are broken down for front-end developers. At catalyze.io we're helping developers quickly and easily cloud-enable apps, building secure and full featured apps for health and wellness in record time.
