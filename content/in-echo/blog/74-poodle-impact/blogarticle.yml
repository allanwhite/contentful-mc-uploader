Body: Another OpenSSL vulnerablility is affecting servers running SSL v3.0. This vulnerability, nicknamed **POODLE**, does not impact any Catalyze servers hosting or transmitting customer data. In fact, we disable SSLv3 (and SSLv2 too!) in all of our server configurations where PHI and customer data is stored. The only configurations we ended up changing were on nginx and apache2 servers that served up static site content (sorry IE6 users!). Our goal is to always err on the side of caution for these types of vulnerabilities.
