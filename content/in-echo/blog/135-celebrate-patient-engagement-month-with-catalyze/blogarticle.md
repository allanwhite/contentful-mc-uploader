All of us at Catalyze are extremely adamant and passionate about all patients seen across the entirety of healthcare. Whether you are the primary care physician for a high-risk patient or an app developer that has no role in direct care, everyone plays a part in how engaged patients are in their treatment and beyond. So join us in celebrating patient engagement this August and spreading awareness for how critical this topic is to the industry as a whole.

We feel strongly about this topic, and we want to help. You can now view an explanation to how Catalyze's services can aide [Patient Engagement](https://catalyze.io/solutions/patient-engagement). As many, even all, experts will tell you, patient engagement is going to be the key force that pilots the way towards the transition from a volume-based to a value-based patient care experience, which will result in lower costs, improved outcomes, and the utmost in patient satisfaction. 

It's not just a matter of what we can do, but also what we did. [We now have available an example of how Catalyze helped The Department of Veterans Affairs engage their patients.](https://catalyze.io/customers/veterans-affairs)

Join us in the engagement movement as this transformation takes place in healthcare over the coming years. Let’s kick off the engagement festivities with three facts about patient engagement you should know!

### 1) Value-based archetypes that have proven successful share common attributes

It has been found that featuring provider accountability for population autonomy and health by clearly stating the specifics of healthcare value delivery will result in greater long-term value. 

### 2) Clinical and non-clinical populace necessities need to be incorporated in delivery transitions

Healthcare providers can bridge the gap between clinical management of high-risk patients and diverse patients by introducing a varied types of clinicians, even introducing existing ones in unaccustomed methods. 

### 3) Personalized market circumstances must be integrated into new engagement models

Payment and delivery paragons cannot be treated as a “one size fits all” solution but instead must cover a broader scale of needs tailored towards the segmented needs of the populace.
