We really excited to be presenting in front a large group of health system CIOs and are grateful to the organizers of the event. We'll be pitching catalyze.io for 5 minutes. It'll be our first opportunity to pitch catalyze.io at an event like this so we've spent a lot of time working on the message.Below is our presentation, limited by the organizers to 3 slides. We hope you enjoy it!StartMeUp Health Presentation<script async class="speakerdeck-embed" data-id="9dbe54f0b3a90130361a6e2d32fdd459" data-ratio="1.33333333333333" src="//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js"></script>
