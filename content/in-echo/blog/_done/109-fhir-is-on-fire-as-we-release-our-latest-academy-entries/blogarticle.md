  As you may have heard, FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) is the new and emerging standard being developed under the [Health Language 7](https://hl7.org/) (HL7) organization and Catalyze has just released THREE new Academy articles so you can stay ahead of the curve on all things FHIR related.

Pronounced as ‘Fire’ (hopefully bringing clarity to the pun in the title), it was initially developed by [Graham Grieve](http://www.healthintersections.com.au/), who insisted upon FHIR being open sourced.

In our [Introduction to FHIR](https://catalyze.io/learn/introduction-to-fhir) Academy article, Catalyze Co-founder and President, [Mohan Balachandran](https://catalyze.io/mohan), guides us through why FHIR was necessary due to the current state of healthcare integration and interoperability and why FHIR brings a better, more modern approach with concepts such as [Restful APIs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and accompanying documentation to integration systems. In this introduction, you will learn what makes FHIR the superior in flexibility, the advantages FHIR has over the existing HL7 standards, and where FHIR is headed from here.

In the second entry to our FHIR series, [The FHIR Resource Object: The Core Building Block](https://catalyze.io/learn/the-fhir-resource-object-the-core-building-block), Mohan guides us through an understanding of the Resource object outlining its origins and intent, but also providing resources to further expand our HL7 comprehension. By listing various resource categories and their structures, including clinical, administrative, and infrastructure, Mohan is able to show how these models allow for the creation of nearly any clinical condition. 

Still want to know more about FHIR? We sure hope so as Mohan’s third entry, [Recommended FHIR API Implementation](https://catalyze.io/learn/recommended-fhir-api-implementation-principles) shows the general design principles that we have followed at [Catalyze](https://catalyze.io/hl7) and what the key underlying principles are when building RESTful APIs.

As always, Catalyze is here to be your trusted resource and partner in all aspects of HL7. Stay tuned for more [Academy entries](https://catalyze.io/learn) as we stay up to date on the latest in digital health!
