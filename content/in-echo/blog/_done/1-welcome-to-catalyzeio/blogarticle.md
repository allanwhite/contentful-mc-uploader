Summary: We’re on a mission to democratize health app development, ahead of our public launch.
Lead: |
  We’re on a mission to **democratize health app development**. We’re just getting started and have a long way to go, but we’ve got a great start because we’ve developed, and are still developing, apps for health and fitness. We also eat, drink, and sleep health tech so we know much of what’s missing, what’s hard, and what should be easier.

A few tenants that help us stay the course:

- Health app development **shouldn’t be harder** than other verticals. Health tech has both technology challenges and a distribution challenges to overcome before it realizes it’s potential.
- Health apps should strive to be **secure, interoperable, and have measurable outcomes**
- Health apps, and health app developers, **shouldn’t compete on HIPAA** compliance and **interoperability**. These shouldn’t be differentiating features, they should be standard - somewhat like having a hosted backend.
- Health app developers should **value consumers** and patients (we don’t care what you call them.
- Health app developers should **value clinicians** as well as their current and future roles in care delivery.
- Health app developers should **leverage open source** tools and **contribute back** to the open source community whenever possible. This doesn’t mean every **line of code** should be open sourced (ours isn’t), but it does mean you should give as well as receive. There are tons of great open source tools available to health app developers and together, by leveraging our collective efforts, all of our endeavors will be richer.
- We love **feedback and input!** We know we’re dependent on health app users and developers to build our product so we never want to lose sight of that, or get disconnected from them.

Please stay tuned as we move closer to our public launch. If you’re interested in being a part of our private beta, please drop us an email.
