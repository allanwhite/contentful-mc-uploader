If you’re like me, the town of Fargo does not conjure up much aside from the 1996 Coen brothers film. Luckily, I got to experience much more on a recent trip to Fargo, ND for Health Pitch 2014. Travis Good, co-founder of Catalyze, pitched for Catalyze alongside 13 other innovators and organizations.

Shane Waslaski (President and CEO of [Intelligent InSites](http://intelligentinsites.com)) was the keynote speaker for this event. He gave an encouraging introduction, stating how the best days in healthcare are ahead of us, and our focus should be on attitude, optimism, and determination.

Along those lines, he introduced us to the fascinating case of the Rosetans. These are a group of people in the village of Roseto, PA. It was discovered that they were incredibly healthy compared to surrounding towns. Their rate of heart attacks was half the rest of the country! In addition to a stellar health status, their village was absent of crime. The situation of these people was so impressive, that in 1962 a slew of investigators came to research why. The results were surprising. These were people who drank and smoke prevalently, ate high-cholesterol foods, and worked in unhealthy environments (eg. slate mines). So what set them apart? How could they maintain such a healthy atmosphere? It was their people, and the relationships between them. This was an incredibly tight-knit community, who made a point of including and taking care of each other—people taking care of people.

Shane also introduced the themes of the event, which were Efficiency in Health, Behavioral Health, and Developing in Health.

After Shane left the stage we heard from the charismatic Mert Iseri, CEO of [SwipeSense](https://www.swipesense.com/). From their website, “According to the CDC, increasing hand hygiene is the best way to prevent illness and infections. SwipeSense is an affordable, data-driven, hand hygiene platform for doing just that.”

A 2013 participate, this year SwipeSense wanted to give updates on their successes. Not only was it exciting to hear how well this company is doing, it was also a source of pride for us at Catalyze, as SwipeSense recently became a customer of ours.

##### On to the pitches!

Each representative had 3 minutes to present their company. They were able to use props and presentations to help explain their products or programs. The event was emcee’d by James Burgum (Co-Founder and Managing Partner of [Arthur Ventures](http://arthurventures.com/)) and Patricia Patron (former CEO of Family Healthcare and currently a visionary social entrepreneur and strategist).

**Stephanie Goetz, Mental Health Issue Advocate - Stephanie Goetz Foundation**

Stephanie had a personal encounter with suicide, when her brother took his life before his 20th birthday. She wants to break down the barriers that keep depression a hushed subject, and empower those who are suffering to feel comfortable speaking about it. [The Stephanie Goetz Mental Wellness Initiative](http://stephaniegoetzfoundation.org/) aims to bring mental health resources to schools, to identify those children who need help, and to educate existing teachers and staff.

**Dan Hodgson, Managing Director - Linn Grove Growth Funds**

Dan talked about seed banks and their purpose. He is encouraging the public to consider stem cell banking, and the importance to one’s own future by making a donation.

**Dr. Shelby Terstriept, Medical Oncologist/Hematologist & Medical Director of Embrace - Sanford Health**

Dr. Shelby encouraged us to change our approach and interactions with cancer patients, and focus on the quality of life rather than the cancer itself. Embrace is a cancer survivorship program, which seeks to celebrate and enhance the quality of life for cancer patients, connect survivors with each other, and educate the community.

**Dr. Barb Stanton, Autism Spectrum Disorders Therapist - Prairie St. Johns**

How do we recognize autism? Dr. Barb educated us on some famous people (including Einstein and Emily Dickinson) who had autism and how certain characteristics of autism were once appreciated and even valued. She wants people to find the person beneath the autism, and embrace and share their unique differences.

**Dr. Donald Warne, Director of the Master of Public Health Program - NDSU**

Dr. Donald educated us on the current health-crisis facing many Native Americans - diabetes. He discussed “the need for a Preservation and Advancement of Traditional Healing program, known as PATH, in which we would work with traditional healers and medicine men from regional tribes to ensure the development of apprenticeship programs in a culturally appropriate manner” … “Many tribes are losing their traditional healers, and traditional cultural approaches could be significant and important in addressing contemporary health issues.” For more information, see this [website](http://www.kittyfarmer.com/medicinewheelfoundation.html).

**Jeff Hoss, VP of Clinical Operations - Sanford Health**

Jeff talked to us about changing the patient experience. He described an environment with better patient flow, where there is no need for a waiting room. The patient goes directly to their care room. The healthcare organization has an onstage and offstage area, in which patients enter from one area and the healthcare givers from another. The rooms are flexible, and can be used for a variety of procedures, and they make use of RTLS (Real Time Location System) to know where patients are at and where they are going.

**Evan Prawda, Student - Patient Proxy**

[Patient Proxy](http://patientproxy.100health.it/) wants a greater focus on patient’s end of life care. They make it easy for people to file an advanced directive, and to share this with their care team, family & friends.

**Tiffany Worth, Vice President of Marketing - Evolution1**

Evolution1 gives the consumer one easy solution to view and interact with flexible spending accounts, health savings accounts, wellness and incentive plans, etc.. Employees can file claims, submit expenses, and upload receipts in a single application. [Evolution1](http://www.evolution1.com/) simplifies the process for employers to give their employees the tools needed to view and manage their various accounts.

**Niko Skievaski, Founder - ICD-10 Illustrated**

How many of you have heard of ICD-10? If you’re in the health industry, chances are you’ve heard of it, and know it’s no fun subject. ICD-10 is an international medical code system, which US healthcare organizations are expected to transition to by October, 2015. Niko brought together a community of artists to illustrate some of the more exciting and bizarre ICD-10 codes. [ICD-10 Illustrated](http://www.icd10illustrated.com/) offers humor and lightheartedness to a dry, government mandate.

**Dr. Susan Mathison, Owner and President - Catalyst Medical Center**

Dr. Susan shared some stories with us about how far physicians will go to take care of their patients, to the point of neglecting themselves. She told us how at times, the price tag of being a physician is too high. In order to heal others, physicians must first take care of themselves. Dr. Susan is putting together a women’s physician retreat to do just that.

**Saurabh Tyagi, CEO and Founder - Medytex**

[Medytex](http://medytex.com/) is a web-based patient feedback system, which is used by the patient at the doctor’s office. This results in a higher percentage of patient feedback received for the clinician. (Not surprisingly, snail-mail surveys have not been reliably returned.) The system also offers different languages, so that all patients will have the opportunity to give their opinions.

**Andrew Dalman, Student - NDSU**

Andrew is a manufacturing engineering student at North Dakota State University. He and his team are working on manufacturing artificial human bone. These artificial yet accurate bones would save money for researchers - they would no longer have to purchase cadavers. In addition, the DOD has expressed interested in this project for testing armor.

**Courtny Evanson, Founder - Nevaeh**

If any of you like word jumbles, you may have already caught this one. It’s “heaven” spelled backwards. Courtny set out to a sanctuary for women to nourish their children. It looks like a jazzed up massage table, which has heating pads and massage rollers. It also has conveniences including phone/tablet holder, cup holder, coat rack, etc. This nursing table is mainly intended for nursing rooms in the workplace.

**Niko Skievaski, Co-Founder - Redox**

Redox recognized the difficulties for application developers in their need to integrate with health systems, and the various languages and standards that need to be hurdled. This company acts as a middleman, taking these web services and translating them appropriately into HL7, to integrate appropriately with the health system’s EHR.

This event was put on by [Emerging Prairie](http://www.emergingprairie.com/), and was hosted by [Family Healthcare](http://famhealthcarefargo.org/). Videos of the pitches can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMo25uE7hoUWG_15lm1sQTQ). After attending this event, and another Emerging Prairie event the next day, it was clear to see how much Fargo believes not only in health startups, but entrepreneurship in general. Their energy and enthusiastic spirit was palpable. This a community who wholeheartedly invests their time and resources into each other. I could not help but draw a parallel between Fargo and the Rosetans - people taking care of people.
