Summary: 
Body: |
Today Ionic [officially launched](//blog.ionic.io/introducing-the-ionic-market-buy-and-sell-ionic-starters-plugins-and-themes/) their new [market](//market.ionic.io) which gives developers the opportunity to buy and sell Ionic goods such as, plugins, templates and starter projects.

Since Catalyze and Ionic share [_The City of Four Lakes_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madison, _Wisconsin) as a headquarters we're always interested in what the other is doing. A few months ago we were contacted by Ionic to see if we'd be interested in featuring a product on their upcoming market. We were delighted to collaborate.

### Deciding on a product

Ionic gives web developers an easy transition into mobile development. Catalyze's [BaaS](//catalyze.io/baas) gives developers an easy transition into HIPAA compliance. Therefore it made sense for us to build a starter template that gives developers a basic application structure while utilizing key BaaS and Ionic features. A few of those include:

- Login
- Logout
- Forgot Password
- Basic Landing Page
- Slide Out Menu

One of our developers, [Anthony](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anthonypleshek), was kind enough to translate his [BaaS tutorial](//catalyze.io/blog/create-a-hipaa-compliant-mobile-application-with-ionic-and-the-catalyze-api) into a working starter template that we could feature on the market.

### Patient Engagement

We recently released [HIPAAGRAM](http://hipaagr.am) as an example of the types of mobile apps developers can make to improve patient engagement, and consequently healthcare as a whole. Ionic is a wonderful option for those digital health companies making similar apps. The framework Ionic is building, and the ideas the community is producing, is precisely the kind of progress that will help impact patient engagement and patient outcomes.

### The Future

We're excited to see Ionic Market grow and we'll continue helping them along the way by contributing!

Don't forget to pick up your copy of the [Catalyze BaaS Seed Starter](//market.ionic.io/starters/catalyze-baas-seed) and as always, don't hesitate to [email us](mailto:hello@catalyze.io) with any questions/feedback.
