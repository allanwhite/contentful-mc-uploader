  Last week [news broke](http://mobihealthnews.com/45296/welkin-health-gets-2m-for-disease-management-coaching-tools-humana-pilot/) of a fundraise by Catalyze customer Welkin Health. We have been working with Welkin for some time, and have been fans of their vision.

[Welkin Health](https://www.welkinhealth.com/) helps case managers stay more engaged with patients with chronic diseases. They started with diabetes but are moving into COPD, hypertension, and congestive heart failure soon.

We think they are a good example of the ground swell of new, smarter tools addressing high-risk, expensive cost centers in healthcare. Collectively, products and services like Welkin will help healthcare be both more efficient _and_ more effective. Catalyze is happy to be a partner and help their cause.

Congrats Welkin on the fund raise!
