Quote: As Catalyze calls integration a “journey” rather than an application provider interface or a static integration engine, Redpoint streamlines and manage the process with three sets of tools: “Scripts,” pre-configured integration sets for specific EHRs; “connectors” to automate data flow between EHRs and third-party apps; and workflows called “bearings” to manage integration projects.
