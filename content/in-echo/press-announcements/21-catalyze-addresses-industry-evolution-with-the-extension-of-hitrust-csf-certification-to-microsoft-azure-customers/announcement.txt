### Catalyze provides approach for Microsoft Azure healthcare enterprise customers that expands trust and tenders better management of regulatory compliance and risk.

MADISON, WIS. (PRWEB) OCTOBER 05, 2016

Catalyze, a leading platform for healthcare IT development teams, today announced renewed security and certifications to address changes in the healthcare industry that reduce third-party risk. The company’s compliant cloud platform will now be extended to customers using Microsoft Azure.

Within the next 12 months, an increasing number of healthcare organizations will require business associates to become certified through the Health Information Trust Alliance Common Security Framework (HITRUST CSF). The certifiable framework offers organizations a more efficient and certifiable approach to risk management and regulatory compliance. As HITRUST CSF Certification has become the industry’s gauge by which compliance and security are measured, Catalyze had already taken the industry’s lead in obtaining CSF Certification of its platform for each supported cloud platform provider.

“For our healthcare customers who run some or all of their business applications in Azure, this HITRUST CSF Certification now provides a rock solid approach to managing, storing and transmitting personal health information,” said Catalyze VP of Engineering Vince Kenney.

Microsoft introduced Azure in October 2008 and since then, the enterprise-class cloud platform has risen in use by healthcare organizations. Many of those organization use Azure as an alternative to their own data center, and run some or all of their business applications in Azure versus investing in on-premise servers and storage.

“As a cloud service provider, Microsoft Azure is in tune with the industry, and specifically the unique needs within healthcare. Catalyze shares our belief in providing a secure and trusted platform upon which to build enterprise-level applications and we applaud the company’s efforts to quickly pinpoint the certifications that diminish third-party risk,” said someone from Microsoft Azure.

“Microsoft Azure is often chosen by large healthcare organizations due to its simple integration with other Microsoft products and that’s why Catalyze chose to extend HITRUST CSF Certification to the cloud platform often used by healthcare institutions,” said Raj Sundaramurthy, Catalyze Chief Product Officer. “Catalyze is proud to play a significant role in the industry by now offering a HITRUST CSF Certified solution for Microsoft Azure enterprise-side clients.”
