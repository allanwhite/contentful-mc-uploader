Post: Expanding its leadership team to address meteoric growth in compliant cloud computing, Catalyze hires Rajashekar Sundaramurthy, former Equifax Identity & Fraud division CIO


Madison, WI - (February 18, 2016)  Catalyze, Inc., a preeminent healthcare leader in cloud computing announces the addition of Raj Sundaramurthy today as Chief Product Officer, bolstering its leadership team of technology and healthcare veterans.

Sundaramurthy is Catalyze’s second high-profile hire since the start of the new year, and this latest addition is well-timed. Healthcare professionals today are faced with a growing multitude of IT applications that are creating record levels of clinically relevant data to be stored, managed, accessed and protected. Health Care Information Technology (HCIT), according to investment research firm [SeekingAlpha](http://seekingalpha.com/article/3897276-cerner-corporation-evolution-revolution-health-care-information-technology),  is “expected to become a $105 billion industry by 2020” as the industry finds innovative ways to deal with increasingly complex and voluminous data.

This strategic hire falls on the heels of Catalyze’s December launch of its [healthcare integration](https://catalyze.io/redpoint) product called Redpoint, and the company has plans for a second product launch next week. Sundaramurthy will have oversight of these products with engineering responsibilities and will oversee development of the company’s transformational integration and platform as a service products as they expand into wider markets.

“Raj brings an enormous wealth of experience and knowledge around managing teams and building products that cater to sizable and regulated industries,” said Catalyze President and Co-founder Mohan Balachandran. “His ability to apply knowledge across regulated industries will be instrumental for Catalyze and will set the foundation for the company’s growth.”

Sundaramurthy joins Catalyze from Equifax where he was CIO for its Identity & Fraud division and Senior Vice-President (Technology) for Equifax’s Technology and Analytical Services division. At Equifax, he led the Product Management, Product Development, Professional Services and Operations for Equifax’s cloud-based Risk Decisioning and Identity Management solutions. Prior to Equifax, Sundaramurthy held leadership positions in product management and development at Dallas-based healthcare solutions provider Net.Orange, Teradata, i2 Technologies and Citicorp. 

“Catalyze offers a rich set of cloud-based compliance and integration services that enable our customers to respond rapidly to market demands while continuing to meet all regulatory requirements” said Sundaramurthy. “As the healthcare industry shifts toward an information-centric care delivery model, I am excited to direct the growth of these solutions to deliver market-leading  collaborative workflows and deeper real-time insights into patient health”
